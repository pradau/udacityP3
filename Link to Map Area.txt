The map area is the city I am living in plus surrounding towns like Woodstock. This is a mid-sized city in Southwestern Ontario and is home to the university I chose for graduate studies, University of Western Ontario.

I chose this area because I am interested in developing this project further to provide a web app to locate amenities like hospitals or cafes while travelling, and would like to test in a region Iâ€™m familiar with and can test against my knowledge.
